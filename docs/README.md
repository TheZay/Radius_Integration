You can install the dependencies using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):

```bash
pip install netmiko ipaddress
```

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**:
    - For users familiar with Git, clone the repository using `git clone [repository-url]`.
    - Alternatively, download the ZIP file from the remote repository and extract it on your machine.

2. **Install Python**: Ensure Python 3.8 or newer is installed on your machine.
   Visit [Python's official site](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for installation instructions.

3. **Install Dependencies**: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the script's directory.
   Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install necessary dependencies.

### Configuration

The `MACollector` script offers customization through its configuration file, `config.json`, located in the `configs`
directory. This file allows you to set parameters for logging and threading. Below is a description of each configurable
item in `config.json`:

#### `config.json` Explained

```json
{
  "log_file_path": "logs\\macollector.log",
  "logging_level": "INFO",
  "max_threads": 16
}
```

- **log_file_path**: Specifies the file path where the log file will be saved. The default path
  is `"logs\\macollector.log"`.
- **logging_level**: Sets the verbosity level of the logs. Available options
  are `"DEBUG"`, `"INFO"`, `"WARNING"`, `"ERROR"`, and `"CRITICAL"`. The default level is `"INFO"`.
- **max_threads**: Determines the maximum number of threads for concurrent processing of network devices. Adjust this to
  optimize performance based on your system's capabilities. The default is `16`.

#### Customizing Configuration

To tailor the script to your needs, you can edit the `config.json` file with your preferred settings. For instance, if
you require more detailed logs, change `"logging_level"` to `"DEBUG"`. If you are working with a large number of network
devices and your system can support higher concurrency, consider increasing `"max_threads"`.

Ensure that you save the `config.json` file after making changes to apply them the next time you run the script.

## Usage Guide

### Running the Script

Navigate to the `scripts` directory and execute the `macollector.cmd` script:

```bash
# Navigate to the scripts directory
cd scripts

# Run the script with options
./macollector.cmd [options]
```

If you are using Linux or macOS, you can run the `macollector.sh` script instead:

```bash
# Navigate to the scripts directory
cd scripts

# Run the script with options
./macollector.sh [options]
```

Please refer to the [Command Line Examples](#command-line-examples) section for detailed usage examples.

### Options

The script provides several command-line options to customize its behavior:

- `-f FILE, --file FILE`: Use a text file containing IP addresses for processing.
- `-i IP, --ip IP`: Specify a single IP address for processing.
- `-r IP_RANGE, --ip-range IP_RANGE`: Define an IP address range for processing (e.g., 10.1.1.0-10.1.1.127).
- `-s SUBNET, --subnet SUBNET`: Specify a subnet range for processing (e.g., 10.1.1.0/24).
- `--log-file-path LOG_FILE_PATH`: Set a custom path for the log file.
- `--log-level {DEBUG,INFO,WARNING,ERROR,CRITICAL}`: Set the logging level for the console output.

### Input Methods

- **File**: Provide a text or YAML file containing IP addresses.
- **Single IP**: Process a specific IP address.
- **IP Range**: Specify a range of IP addresses.
- **Subnet**: Define a subnet range for processing.

### Logging and Output

- The script's logging behavior can be adjusted in the `config.json` file.
- Collected MAC addresses are exported to either an XML file for integration with ClearPass or a plain text file.

## Command Line Examples

Note that the examples below are for Windows users. If you are using
Linux or macOS, you can run the `macollector.sh` script instead.

```bash
# Process a Single IP Address:
.\macollector.cmd -i 192.168.1.1
```

![Single IP Address](images/single_ip_example.jpg)

```bash
# Process a range of IP Addresses plus a single IP Address:
# Note: The range and single IP are separated by a comma.
#       *If you type a space after the comma, use quotes around the range.*
.\macollector.cmd -r "10.1.1.1, 10.1.1.10-20"
```

![IP Range](images/ip_range_example.jpg)

```bash
# Process a range of IP Addresses:
# Note: The range of IPs can be fully typed out or use shorthand notation as shown in the above example.
.\macollector.cmd -r 10.1.1.10-10.1.1.20
```

![IP Range](images/ip_range_example_2.jpg)

```bash
# Process a Subnet:
.\macollector.cmd -s 192.168.0.0/24  # CIDR Notation
```

![Subnet](images/subnet_example.jpg)

```bash
# Process IP Addresses from a Text File and log to a custom Log File:
.\macollector.cmd -f ip_list.txt --log-file-path custom_log_file_path.log
```

![Text File & Log Path](images/text_file_and_log_path_change.jpg)

```bash
# Change the Console Handler (prints to screen) Log Level to DEBUG
.\macollector.cmd -f ip_list.txt --log-level DEBUG
```

![Text File & Log Level](images/text_file_and_log_level_change.jpg)

```bash
# Process IP Addresses from a YAML File:
.\macollector.cmd -f ip_list.yml
```

![Yaml File](images/yml_file_example.jpg)

```bash
# Process IP Addresses from an Enhanced YAML File:
.\macollector.cmd -f ip_list.yaml
```

## File Format Examples

Here's an example of what the text file (`ip_list.txt`) and the YAML file (`inventory.yml`) should look like for the
Switch MAC Collector Script:

### Text Files (`ip_list.txt`)

```text
192.168.1.1
192.168.1.2
192.168.1.3
```

In the text file, each line represents an IP address of a network device. You can add as many IP addresses as needed,
one per line.

### YAML File (`inventory.yml`)

```yaml
hosts:
  - ip: 192.168.1.1
  - ip: 192.168.1.2
  - host: 192.168.1.3
```

In the YAML file, you define a list of hosts under the "hosts" key. Each host in the list should have a "host" key with
its corresponding IP address. You can add or remove hosts as necessary.

### Enhanced YAML File (`inventory.yaml`)

```yaml
hosts:
  - host: Switch1
    ip: 192.168.1.1
  - host: Switch2
    ip: 192.168.1.2
  - host: Switch3
    ip: 192.168.1.3
```

In this enhanced YAML file, you can also specify a "hostname" for each host in addition to the "host" key. This allows
you to associate a friendly name with each IP address, making it easier to identify the devices in your network.

#### YAML File Explained

1. The 'host' key or 'ip' key is required for each entry.
2. The 'host' key is intended for the hostname or fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the network
   device.
    - The 'host' key may also be used to specify the IP address, but it is recommended to use the 'ip' key for
      clarity and consistency.
    - The hostname is optional and can be omitted as the script will ignore it. However, it can be useful for
      reference and organization.
3. The 'ip' key is used to specify the IP address of the network device.
    - An IP address is **required** for each entry and must be valid for the script to process it.

These files serve as input sources for the Switch MAC Collector Script, allowing you to specify the IP addresses of the
network devices you want to process.

## Troubleshooting

Encountering issues while using the Switch MAC Collector Script? Here are some common problems and their solutions:

### 1. Connection Timeout or Failure

**Problem**: The script fails to connect to a network switch, resulting in a timeout or connection failure error.

**Solution**:

- Ensure that the network device is powered on and connected to the network.
- Verify that the SSH service is enabled on the device.
- Confirm that the username and password entered are correct.

### 2. Incorrect MAC Address Data

**Problem**: The MAC addresses collected do not match expectations or seem incorrect.

**Solution**:

- Ensure that the IP range or subnet specified covers the intended devices.
- Verify that the network devices are configured correctly and are reporting MAC addresses accurately.

### 3. XML Export Issues

**Problem**: The MAC addresses are collected but not properly exported to an XML file.

**Solution**:

- Check the MACollector's write permissions in the directory where the XML file is being saved.
- Ensure the MACollector's configuration for the XML export format is correct.

### 4. Dependency Errors

**Problem**: The MACollector package fails to run due to missing Python dependencies.

**Solution**:

- Make sure Python 3.6 or newer is installed.
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all required dependencies, ensuring the `requirements.txt` file
  includes `netmiko`, `paramiko`, and `pyyaml`.

### 5. Script Execution Errors

**Problem**: General errors or unexpected behavior during script execution.

**Solution**:

- Check the console output and log files for error messages.
- Ensure that the latest version of the script is being used.
- Review the command-line arguments to ensure they are correctly formatted.
